# Intro-ML

This repository showcases a collection of projects that combine computer science, machine learning, and visualization, part of my machine learning course.

Projects include:
- Tracking and transformation pipelines using affine models
- Machine learning experiments in pose estimation, regression, and classification
- Visualization tools for overlaying movement on static maps and video frames
- Student-friendly code designed to explain core concepts clearly


These projects reflect a hands-on approach to learning and teaching technical concepts. Whether you're a student, educator, or developer, you're welcome to explore, contribute, and build on the work here.
